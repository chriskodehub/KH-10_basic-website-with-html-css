        <h2>Cherry</h2>
        <p>A cherry is the fruit of many plants of the genus Prunus, and is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit).
            Commercial cherries are obtained from cultivars of several species, such as the sweet Prunus avium and the
            sour Prunus cerasus. The name 'cherry' also refers to the cherry tree and its wood, and is sometimes applied
            to almonds and visually similar flowering trees in the genus Prunus, as in "ornamental cherry" or "cherry
            blossom". Wild cherry may refer to any of the cherry species growing outside cultivation, although Prunus
            avium is often referred to specifically by the name "wild cherry" in the British Isles. </p>

        <h2>The history of ice cream </h2>
        <p>Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or cream
            and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or
            with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid
            nitrogen together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below
            the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals
            from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or
            35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases. </p>

        <h2>Italian food</h2>
        <p>Pasta (US: /ˈpɑːstə/, UK: /ˈpæstə/; Italian pronunciation: [ˈpasta]) is a type of food typically made from an
            unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then
            cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of
            wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food
            of Italian cuisine.</p>
